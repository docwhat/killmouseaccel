# KillMouseAccel

In OS-X, it has a rather aggressive acceleration curve for mice.

Normally, this works fine.

But if you use a gaming mouse (like [Razer](http://www.razerzone.com/)) then you probably don't want the acceleration.  It can cause things to become jumpy or otherwise misbehave.

## Origin

This is originally code found on http://forums3.armagetronad.net/viewtopic.php?p=196564#p196564

I just put it into an xcode project, removed the warnings and got it to compile.

I wanted to make sure I could find this code again if I had to re-install everything.
