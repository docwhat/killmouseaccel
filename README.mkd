# KillMouseAccel

In OS-X, it has a rather aggressive acceleration curve for mice.

Normally, this works fine.

But if you use a gaming mouse (like [Razer](http://www.razerzone.com/)) then you probably don't want the acceleration.  It can cause things to become jumpy or otherwise misbehave.

## Origin

This is originally code found on http://forums3.armagetronad.net/viewtopic.php?p=196564#p196564

I just put it into an xcode project, removed the warnings and got it to compile.

I wanted to make sure I could find this code again if I had to re-install everything.

## Build with Clang

If you do not want to use xcode, here is a command to compile with just the killmouseaccel/main.c source file.

```
clang -framework CoreFoundation -framework IOKit killmouseaccel/main.c -o ~/Desktop/killmouseaccel
```
